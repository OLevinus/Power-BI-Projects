*  Diversity & Inclusion: In this Power BI project, I analyzed HR diversity and inclusion data for a telecom company. The goal was to provide insights into gender balance, employee turnover, promotion rates, and overall workforce diversity. The project highlights key metrics to support the company's efforts in fostering an inclusive workplace. https://github.com/OLevinus/Diversity-Inclusion-Power-BI
